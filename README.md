# 🧪 Project: Generic Methods - Level 2

## 📌 Description

This project corresponds to Level 2 of the Java generics practice. It starts with a `Persona` class containing basic attributes (`name`, `surname`, and `age`), and a `GenericMethods` class with a generic method that accepts three generic arguments and prints them to the console.

Throughout the exercises, the method is modified to:
- Accept one of the arguments as a non-generic type.
- Accept a variable-length list of arguments using varargs (`...`).

These exercises demonstrate the flexibility and behavior of generic methods with custom classes, strings, primitives, and mixed data types.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlvaroLMC/1.6-Generics-Level2.git

  Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

  Make sure the Java SDK is correctly configured.
